# üé® AI Image Generation Hub

[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](./README.md)

An advanced, all-in-one web application for AI image generation. This platform provides an intuitive **Web User Interface** to interact with a suite of powerful text-to-image models, including **Qwen-Image, Flux, Kontext, Krea**, and the multimodal **Nano Banana**.

Built with a robust Deno backend, it offers a seamless and professional-grade creative experience.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Multi-Model Support**: Switch seamlessly between various state-of-the-art image generation models right from the main interface.
*   **Intuitive Web UI**: A clean, modern, and responsive user interface designed for a professional workflow.
*   **Advanced Generation Controls**:
    *   **Text-to-Image**: Full control over positive & negative prompts, resolution, sampling steps, guidance scale (CFG), and seed.
    *   **Multimodal (Nano Banana)**: Combine text prompts with uploaded images for image-to-image tasks.
*   **Batch Generation**: Generate up to 4 images at once. The app intelligently handles API rate limits by switching between concurrent (for Flux) and sequential (for Qwen) requests.
*   **Smart Session Memory**:
    *   **Persistent Inputs**: All your prompts and parameter settings for each model are saved for the duration of your session. Switch between models without losing your work.
    *   **Background Tasks**: Start a generation task, switch to another model, and come back later. The app keeps track of running tasks and restores the view, complete with progress updates.
*   **Professional UX**:
    *   **Light & Dark Mode**: Toggle between themes to suit your preference.
    *   **Dynamic Progress Updates**: Get real-time feedback when generating multiple images (e.g., "Generating 2/4...").
    *   **Fullscreen Preview**: Click on any generated image to view it in a fullscreen modal.
*   **Smart API Key Handling**:
    *   Set `XI_TOKEN` and `MODELSCOPE_API_KEY` as environment variables during deployment to hide the input fields for a clean, shareable interface.
    *   Supports entering keys directly in the UI if environment variables are not set.
    *   Supports multiple, comma-separated API keys in environment variables for random, stateless load balancing.
